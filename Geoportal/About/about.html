        Country’s engagement in watershed management approach over the last 25 years is considered to be relevant till
        today as over exploitive tendency of natural resources in general and soil in particular. In addition to this,
        the adverse impact of climate change across the globe with frequent occurrence of extreme events at regional
        level imposed severe challenges on agricultural production. Although the earlier approach of watershed
        development proved its manifesto; however, the redesigning of the concept with respect to farming community
        development through natural resource conservation and management, direct participation of the stakeholders in
        agricultural planning, implementation and evaluation process, robust system of monitoring and securing
        livelihood through a balanced development of supply chain model to ensure India’s commitment towards Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs) 2030.

    <p>Therefore, Land Resource Inventory (LRI) based land use planning at watershed level would be a vital landmark to
        begin with at least 10% area in the plateau and upland region as referred in section 19.1.2 (b) of WDC-PMKSY 2.0
        guideline in the direction of bringing visible benefits for the improvement and sustainability of agricultural
        and allied sectors in rainfed areas for overall community development. LRI is an important tool to generate land
        resource information with the help of geo-spatial technique followed by thorough field visit, soil profile
        study, sampling, analysis, data interpretation, characterization and classification of soils, land use planning,
        soil and water conservation measures and subsequent dissemination of the information to the farmers as well as
        other stake holders for further use and implementation programme. In addition to LRI the agro-ecological zone
        approach will be most effective for regeneration of in-situ resources for sustaining the biological growth as
        referred in section 7.2 of WDC-PMKSY 2.0. Agro-ecological region and agro-ecological subregion developed by
        ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS&LUP) is an upscaling of Agro-climatic region of
        erstwhile Planning Commission by adding the information of soil moisture and Length of Growing Period (LGP).
        Soil health and crop management practices are to be determined and recommended according socio-economic
        stratification keeping in view the climate change scenario, soil-site suitability and land capability of the
        particular soils under consideration. The overall livelihood security refers to the assured income irrespective
        of equality and equity issues which on the other way will enhance the income security to the resource poor
        farmers, nutritional security for the consumers and ensuring ecological sustainability within the watershed.
        This is because several government programmes have already been initiated in the country to judicially utilize
        and manage the natural resources, enhance agricultural production and assure livelihood promotion through
        director participation of the stakeholders of a particular watershed.

    <p>LRI is a scientific study of soil, water and related resources at the field level by studying the profiles up to
        2 meters or till parent material and this study is different from traditional soil health card which gives only
        limited information. LRI gives a diagnostic picture of soil in terms of physical and chemical characteristics,
        nutrients status, suitability of crops and soil and water conservations treatment required. Alongside, it also
        provides soil survey interpretations regarding monitoring natural resources, modelling soil physiographic
        relation, predictions about the potential of soils for alternative uses, land use options and ascertaining their
        management requirements for sustainable production.

        Hence, the study was carried out with following objectives:
        <ol>
            <li>To delineate the land use/land cover and landform map of the micro-watersheds using geospatial technique.</li>
            <li>To characterize and map the soil and water resources of the micro-watersheds.</li>
            <li>To assess the soil-site suitability of the crops based on land evaluation at micro-watershed level.</li>
            <li>To develop micro-watershed based soil and water conservation plan.</li>
          </ol>
